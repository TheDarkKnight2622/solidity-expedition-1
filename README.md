# solidity-expedition-1
**Summary:** 
- Documents my nascent journey into building smart contracts using solidity-- with a primary focus on the ethereum chain. 

I have broken down my forage into solidity into three main phases:

- **Phase 1: Bootcamp Basics** – Learning the foundations of Solidity through simple projects and hands-on practice.
- **Phase 2: Black Belt Solidity** – Advanced contract patterns, security practices, and interactions.
- **Phase 3: DeFi Mastery** – Building complex dApps and DeFi strategies, including bots and flash loans.
- **Cheatsheets** – Quick references and best practices for Solidity development.

I will provide timely updates to my progress. 

By the end of this journey, I should have gained a strong foundation on how to develop smart contracts/DApps to fulfill specific purposes on the Web3 space.
